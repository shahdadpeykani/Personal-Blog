# Personal-Blog
This is a blog website I created to showcase the technologies I've learned since starting my journey with Python. The site is built using the Bootstrap framework for a sleek, responsive design. Blog data is dynamically pulled from a JSON API, and the site includes a contact form that allows users to send emails directly.
